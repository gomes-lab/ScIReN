# BINNS

This code implements the method proposed in "Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) for Improving Accuracy of Model
Prediction and Scientific Understanding of Soil Organic Carbon" (Xu et al. 2025). 

## Installation Instructions

You can follow these steps. The key packages to install are mat73, netCDF, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric (including the optional dependencies).


Create a virtual env called ".venv", and activate it
```
cd src_binns
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install pip (upgrade if needed)
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use graph neural network, you may need to install these libraries as well. These are not needed for normal BINN.
```
pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.0+cu124.html
```

You need to download the PRODA parameters from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AGDlybz35n3gHqyNilVthVzOaBkNZAXr/view?usp=sharing), place in the `ENSEMBLE/INPUT_DATA` directory, and unzip. One way to download this is using `gdown`:
```
pip install gdown
cd ENSEMBLE/INPUT_DATA
gdown 1AGDlybz35n3gHqyNilVthVzOaBkNZAXr
unzip PRODA_Results_Subset.zip
```

### Alternate commands to install

If installing the `requirements.txt` file did not work, you can try manually installing packages.
```
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn geopandas mat73 netCDF4
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio 
pip install torch_geometric
```

## Running Instructions

The script `BINN_clean/src_binns/run_binn.sh` contains an example of how to train on 4 GPUs from command-line (interactively). Run like this:
```
cd BINN_clean/src_binns
chmod +x run_binn.sh  # If execute permission not enabled
./run_binn.sh
```

The script `BINN_clean/src_binns/run_binn_slurm.sh` contains an example of how to train on 4 GPUs on a server with the Slurm scheduler.

## Code summary

* `src_binns/run_binn_interactive.sh`: contains command to run BINN training. Change `--num_CPU` to the number of GPUs, or CPUs if no GPUs are available.
    - `--representative_sample` restricts the data to a "representative sample" of ~1000 sites. Useful for initial testing.
    - You can also choose a random subsample with `--n_datapoints 1000`
* `src_binns/binns_DDP.py`: main train script
    - Set `data_dir_input`, `data_dir_output`
    - `current_data_x[:, :, 0, 0]`: input features, shape `[batch, num_features]`
        - Other stuff in this tensor is forcing (e.g. weather) variables
        - `0:12` - each month (averaged across 20 yrs)
        - `0:20` - each soil layer
        - `current_data_*` includes train/val/test. The individual splits are `train_*`, `val_*`, `test_*`.
    - `y`: SOC (soil organic carbon) observations, shape `[batch, 200]`
        - Each site may have up to 200 observations, but usually much less. Extra entries are nan.
    - `z`: depth of each SOC observation, same format as y. `z[i, j]` is the depth of observation `y[i, j]`. Example:
        - `y: [ 50000 20000 10000 nan nan nan ...]`
        - `z: [ 0.1  0.3  0.75 nan nan nan ...]`
    - Model predicts SOC at 20 predefined depths (`zsoi`). For each site, we then linearly interpolate to predict at the specific depths in “z”
    - `c`: longitude/latitude coordinates, shape `[batch, 2]`
    - `current_proda_para`: biogeochemical parameters predicted by the previous PRODA method, shape `[batch, num_parameters]`
    - Search `args.split` for the code that splits data into train/val/test.
    - `predict_data_*` is grid data, where we have input features (x), coordinates (c), and PRODA parameters, but no SOC observations. We use this to make nationwide predictions using a trained model.
* `src_binns/mlp.py`: deep learning models
    - `mlp_wrapper` is "baseline BINN". Usage: `--model new_mlp`
        - MLP: maps input features → biogeochemical parameters
        - Process-based model: maps biogeochemical parameters + forcing → SOC predictions at 20 depths
    - `nn_only` is pure-neural network without the process-based model. Usage: `--model nn_only`
        - Directly maps input features → SOC predictions at 20 depths
* `src_binns/fun_matrix_clm5_vectorized.py`: process-based model
    - Estimates amount of carbon in 140 pools (20 depths * 7 pools per layer)
    - `a_matrix`: 140x140 matrix, containing horizontal transfers between pools of the same layer. `A[i, j]` (if `i != j`) is the flux from pool j to i. `A[i, i]` is the total flux leaving pool i.
    - `kk_matrix`: 140x140 matrix. `KK[i, i]` is the decomposition rate for pool i. Nondiagonal entries are zero.
    - `tri_matrix`: 140x140 matrix, containing vertical transfers. `Tri[i, j]` (if `i != j`) is the flux from pool j to i. `Tri[i, i]` is the total flux leaving pool i. Only the three middle diagonals contain nonzero entries, meaning that there is only transfer between adjacent layers of the same pool type.
    - Each of these has a vectorized and non-vectorized implementation. They should produce the same result, vectorized is faster.
* `src_binns/fun_matrix_clm5_vectorized_bulk.py` is similar to above, but also outputs additional quantities (various combinations of parameters) that are used in final visualizations
* `losses.py`: code for loss functions
